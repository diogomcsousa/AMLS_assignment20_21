# AMLS_assignment_20_21

This work contains four tasks in the computer vision area, more specifically image processing with the defined objective
for a better understanding of machine learning systems and acquire experience in dealing with real-world data. 
Two of the proposed tasks are binary classiÔ¨Åcation problems, on Gender Detection and Smile Detection. The other two 
tasks are multiclass classification problems on Face Shape Detection and Eye Color Detection. The pipeline used 
to solve this tasks consists of three steps. First it is done a feature extraction from the region of interest (ROI), 
then the model is selected and trained with different values for its parameters, finally a test set is used to get 
performance of the model. For these tasks different techniques for feature extraction were used, such as Face Encoding, 
Facial Landmark Detector and Haar Cascade features. Regarding the model, it was used an SVM polynomial kernel 
classifier for every task, with different parameters. After this process different performances were verified, from 72% to 98%.
